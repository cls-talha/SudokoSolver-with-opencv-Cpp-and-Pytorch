# Sudoku Solver via Webcam
## Introduction
This project is a Sudoku Solver that uses deep learning techniques for digit recognition. It is built using OpenCV for image processing and PyTorch for digit classification. The solver is capable of taking an image of a Sudoku puzzle as input and outputting the solved puzzle.
##  PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python to build and train deep learning models. Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. PyTorch offers a high-level interface for building neural networks and supports both static and dynamic computational graphs. It also provides a wide range of pre-built modules and utilities, making it easy for non-technical users to implement advanced machine learning techniques. 
 ## Opencv(c++)
 OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library written in C++. It provides a wide range of functions and algorithms related to image and video processing, including object detection and motion analysis. It is used extensively in various industries, such as automotive, robotics, and security, as well as in research.
